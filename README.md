# Reflect XSS Fuzzer Detector

Welcome to the **Reflect XSS Fuzzer Detector**! ðŸš€ This tool is designed to help you detect **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerabilities in web applications. By simulating malicious inputs, this fuzzer allows you to identify potential security flaws that could be exploited by attackers.

## Why You Should Care

Reflected XSS is one of the most common web vulnerabilities, where malicious scripts are executed as a result of user input being reflected by the server. This tool makes it easy to test for these vulnerabilities and secure your web applications from malicious attacks.

## How It Works

This simple but powerful Python script fuzzes URLs or input data to find potential XSS vulnerabilities in reflected responses. It substitutes specific parameters in your input with custom values (e.g., malicious scripts or fuzz strings) and checks for reflections in the response.

## Usage

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/).

### Running the Fuzzer:

To run the tool, use the following command:

echo "<input_data>" | python fuzzer.py "<fuzz_input>"

##Example:
Let's say you want to test a URL with a potential XSS vulnerability:

echo "http://example.com/?search=<script>alert('xss')</script>" | python fuzzer.py "test_fuzz"

## What's Happening in the Code?

The tool receives a fuzz input from the command line.
It reads input line by line from the standard input.
For each line, a regular expression (regex) searches for any values that come after the = sign and replaces them with the fuzz input.
The script outputs the modified URL or request.
This way, you can easily simulate different types of input and check how the server reacts to it!
